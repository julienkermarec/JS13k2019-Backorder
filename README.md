# BACK ORDER STORE HOUSE

"BACK ORDER STORE HOUSE" 

It's Black Friday, you need to dispatch all the parcels on backorder to the proper airports.

1. Look for orders airport code & id
2. Find the box with the matching code
3. Grab the box & place it on the appropriate conveyor belt

Unlimited levels : 120 seconds to send multiple orders. My best score : Level 5 !
Hard mode : If you want difficulty, activate "airport code only" mode

Usage :

Click on box to grab them, and after tou have two choices :
    Click on countries dock to send them OR
    Click on the initial box position to cancel

Options :
